# Titanic_Kaggle_MachineLearning

This is a stacked approach to the Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning Dataset.

It contains a stacked Ensemble of:
1. Support Vector Classifier
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Gradient Boosted Trees Classifier
5. K Nearest Neighbors Classifier
6. XGBoost Classifier
7. MultiLayer Perceptron Classifier
8. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier

The final evalutation model of stack is Logistic Regression.

Basic Feature Engineering

Gives Cross-Validation Score of 83% on training set, 80% on validation set and 77.8% on test set.
